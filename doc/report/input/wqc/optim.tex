After the model type being fixed, there would be certain loss function regarding
the selected model. The key of model fitting is to decide the parameters, which
are derived by minimizing the loss function. Therefore, certain optimization
techniques should be applied during the fitting.

In \texttt{optim.py}, we provide several optimization methods including
stochastic gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent with momentum and
Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) method \cite{boyd2004convex}.  The
methods will be called by the \texttt{Solver} class, which take the current
iteration point, the gradient value and the configuration parameters as input
and return the next iteration point. The user can choose the optimization
methods according to the scale of the problem.
