This demo shows how to use the \texttt{OptionPricing} class to calculate the
price of an option.  We choose \texttt{Google} stock and use 490 daily price to
calculate the volatility.  We set the strike price $K = 800$ and expiry time $T
= 90$ days. Based on the the Black-Scholes model, we can calculate the call
option price $V(S, t)$ given current time $t$ and stock price $S$, showed in
Figure~\ref{fig_option_pricing}. When viewing $V$ as the function of $S$, there
is a sharp corner at $S = 800$ when $t = T$, and the function is smooth at $t =
0$, which is the same as the real situation in the market.
