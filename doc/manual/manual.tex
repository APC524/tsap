\section{Introduction}
Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. It is widely used in signal processing, pattern recognition, mathematical finance, weather forecasting, earthquake prediction, control engineering, and largely in any domain of applied science and engineering which involves temporal measurements.

In this project, we will play a game with time series in finance. It has gained its popularity in Wall Street recently, since it is fundamental to most promising quantitative investment strategies. We develop a system that can predict future prices of stocks using various kinds of methods for time series analysis. 

This manual is a brief introduction of the functionality of our package. In specific,  we illustrate  how to use the provided functions to fit the model, predict the stock price, trade, cluster etc. Introduction of the main source files and key functions is also included.

We  utilize standard packages from python including \texttt{numpy}, \texttt{scipy}, and \texttt{matplotlib}. The integration of \texttt{C} code  and \texttt{Python} code is based on the \texttt{Cython} package.

\section{Program Structure}
The high-level program structure is shown in Figure \ref{fig:structure}. The division of work is pretty even, and there are some minor work that are too trivial to mention extensively here.

Overall, the program consists of two parts. The first part deals with a single time series, and exploits the time correlation within the time series. There is data preprocessing module that takes the raw data and get the right data format for later analysis. Optimization, model, and solver are used all together to fit the models using maximum likelihood estimation. Finally, there is a post processing module that makes use of the information from model. The post processing module includes parameter inference, trading strategy, and option pricing. The second part deals with a collection of time series of data, basically it exploits the correlation between different time series. In this way, we can gain more insights into the financial market. While these insights are impossible to obtain from a single time series.

\section{Functionality}
To start with, we will give an description of the source files.
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{basemodel.py}: Provided the basemodel of time series.
\item \texttt{cluster.py}:  Provided the \texttt{Cluster} class for clustering. It includes four clustering methods: k-means, hierarchy clustering, Gaussian mixture modeling, and spectral clustering.
\item \texttt{Data\_prossessor.py}:  Provided the transforming function between stock price and return, the function getting the maximum drawdown and the function returning the indicator of peak and trough.

\item \texttt{Gradient\_check.py}: Provided the function for deriving numerical gradient.

\item \texttt{Inference.py}: Provided functions for computing the auto-covariance of \texttt{AR} model and testing significance of parameters.

\item \texttt{Model.py}: Provided model class \texttt{AR} and \texttt{MA}, including functions for computing the log-likelihood and gradient given the data and an \texttt{AR} or \texttt{MA} model and the function for future price prediction.

\item \texttt{Optim.py}: Provided several optimization methods: stochastic gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent with momentum update and Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm

\item \texttt{Option\_pricing.py}: Provided functions for option pricing.

\item \texttt{Reduction.py}: Provided functions for dimensional reduction for data visualization.

\item \texttt{Solver.py}: Provided functions for model fitting using maximum likelihood estimation given the data and the specified model.

\item \texttt{Trading.py}: Provided functions for deciding the transaction time point based on future price prediction and computing profit over the time.

\item \texttt{Ts\_gen.pyx} \& \texttt{c\_ts\_gen.c}: Provided functions to generate simulation data.
